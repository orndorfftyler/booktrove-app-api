### Summary

BookTrove allows you to read and write reviews of your favorite books. Users first sign up or log in before accessing the search page.

Clicking on a book in the search results brings you to a page which lists the reviews left for that book by other BookTrove users. Users may indicate which reviews they found useful and leave their own review.
